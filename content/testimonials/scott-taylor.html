<p>Just wanted to drop you a quick note to let
you know that I just installed FireHOL 1.120
on my Linux router/firewall, and it worked like
a champ!</p>
<p>Super-easy (your example on the FireHOL web page
is a perfect starting point for setups like mine,
which is a single PC doing NAT/MASQ and firewalling
over DSL for an internal LAN) and much more
effective than my old stateless firewall that
it replaced (which wouldn't even let me ftp without
shutting it down).</p>
<p>Just wanted to say thanks for a job well done, and
for making your work available to the rest of us!</p>
